                                        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

                                        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                                        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                                        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                                        official operating system of your device. It could make your
                                        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                                        compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                                        that the qwe app won’t work properly or at all.

                                        You should be aware that there are certain things that
                                        Abhilash Das will not take responsibility for. Certain
                                        functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                                        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                                        by your mobile network provider, but Abhilash Das
                                        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                                        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                                        have any of your data allowance left.
                                    </p>

                                        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                                        should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                                        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                                        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                                        other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                                        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                                        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                                        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                                        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                                        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                                        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                                    </p>

                                        Along the same lines, Abhilash Das cannot always take
                                        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                                        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                                        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                                        Abhilash Das cannot accept responsibility.
                                    </p>

                                        With respect to Abhilash Das’s responsibility for your
                                        use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                                        bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                                        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                                        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                                        to you. Abhilash Das accepts no liability for any
                                        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of

                                        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is

                                        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                                        using the app. Abhilash Das does not promise that it
                                        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you

                                        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the

                                identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                                me with personal information, I immediately
                                delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                                and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                                personal information, please contact me so that
                                I will be able to do necessary actions.
